# Potato Leaf Disease Classification using CNN

## Problem Statement

Farmers worldwide face significant economic losses and crop waste due to various diseases affecting potato plants. Early blight and late blight are among the most devastating diseases that impact potato leaves, causing substantial yield losses annually. Traditional methods of disease identification are often time-consuming, require expert knowledge, and may not provide timely diagnosis for effective intervention.

The challenge is to develop an automated, accurate, and scalable solution that can:
- Quickly identify potato leaf diseases from images
- Distinguish between healthy leaves and diseased ones
- Classify specific disease types (early blight vs. late blight)
- Enable early detection for timely treatment
- Be accessible to farmers regardless of their technical expertise

## Solution Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify potato leaf images into three distinct categories:
1. **Healthy** - Normal, disease-free potato leaves
2. **Early Blight** - Leaves affected by early blight disease
3. **Late Blight** - leaves affected by late blight disease

The solution leverages deep learning techniques to automatically extract features from leaf images and provide accurate disease classification, enabling farmers to make informed decisions about crop management.


## Key Features

- High Accuracy: Achieves 97–100% classification accuracy on test data.
- Three-Class Classification: Identifies healthy, early blight, and late blight potato leaves.
- Automated Detection: Scalable for large-scale deployment in farms.
- Real-World Integration Ready: Can be deployed in mobile apps, drones, or smart farming devices.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV (for preprocessing)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook

### Early Detection Capabilities
- Enables **early and accurate detection** of disease symptoms
- Helps farmers take **timely and targeted actions**
- Reduces crop loss through preventive measures
