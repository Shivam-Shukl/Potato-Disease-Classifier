# Potato Leaf Disease Classifier

## Problem Statement

Farmers face significant economic losses and crop waste every year due to diseases affecting potato crops. Two major leaf diseases — Early Blight and Late Blight — are responsible for a large portion of the yield loss.

Manual disease detection is slow, error-prone, and impractical for large-scale farms. There is a growing need for an automated and scalable solution that can detect these diseases early to help farmers take timely action.

## Objective

To develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based image classification model that accurately classifies potato leaf images into three categories:

- Healthy
- Early Blight
- Late Blight

## Solution Overview

- Used a CNN model trained on a publicly available potato leaf dataset.
- Achieved an accuracy of 97%–100% across test images.
- Model can classify potato leaf diseases with high precision and robustness.
- Helps farmers in early and accurate detection, preventing further crop damage.

## Key Features

- High Accuracy: Achieves 97–100% classification accuracy on test data.
- Three-Class Classification: Identifies healthy, early blight, and late blight potato leaves.
- Automated Detection: Scalable for large-scale deployment in farms.
- Real-World Integration Ready: Can be deployed in mobile apps, drones, or smart farming devices.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV (for preprocessing)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook
